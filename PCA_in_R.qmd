## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Load the tidyverse

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")

```

install broom

```{r}

devtools::install_github("tidymodels/broom")

```

load libraries

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

library(broom)

library(cowplot)
```

To read a bit about broom ...

```{r}
?broom
```

We'll be analyzing the biopsy dataset, which comes originally from the MASS package. It is a breast cancer dataset from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. He assessed biopsies of breast tumors for 699 patients; each of nine attributes was scored on a scale of 1 to 10. The true outcome (benign/malignant) is also known.

```{r}
#read in the biopsy data
biopsy <- read_csv("https://wilkelab.org/classes/SDS348/data_sets/biopsy.csv")


```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#write out the data for future use

write_csv(x = biopsy, "biopsy.csv")
```
