## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Load the tidyverse

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")

```

install broom

```{r}

devtools::install_github("tidymodels/broom")

```

load libraries

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

library(broom)
```

```{r}
?broom
```
